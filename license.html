SGP4 - (Simplified General Perturbations #4)

THIS OPEN SOURCE AGREEMENT (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;) DEFINES THE RIGHTS OF USE,
REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, MODIFICATION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN
COMPUTER SOFTWARE ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AS REPRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY LISTED BELOW (&quot;GOVERNMENT
AGENCY&quot;).  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AS REPRESENTED BY GOVERNMENT
AGENCY, IS AN INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT
DISTRIBUTIONS OR REDISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE.  ANYONE WHO
USES, REPRODUCES, DISTRIBUTES, MODIFIES OR REDISTRIBUTES THE SUBJECT
SOFTWARE, AS DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT ACTION,
ACCEPTING IN FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
IN THE SOFTWARE.

The intended purpose of the SGP4 propagator is to properly propagate an
object&#39;s Two Line Element Set (TLE) supplied by 18 Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS)
such that the positions calculated for that object agree with those
calculated by 18 SDS.  SGP4 propagator is to be used solely for the
purpose of propagating 18 SDS created TLEs.  TLEs created and supplied by the
18 SDS are created in such a way as to be compatible with the SGP4
propagator.  In this way, compatibility/interoperability issues between the
18 SDS and the user of 18 SDS SGP4 TLEs are addressed. Examples of what SGP4
should not be used for, included but are not limited to, propagating 18 SDS
created state vectors which come from any of the various other messages the
18 SDS creates, such as Vector Covariance Messages, Orbital Conjunction
Messages, Conjunction Data Messages, etc.
